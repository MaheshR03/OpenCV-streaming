## Potential Enhancements

1. **Add Audio Streaming**
   - Integrate audio alongside video for a complete streaming experience.

2. **Multi-Client Support**
   - Allow multiple clients to connect to the server and stream simultaneously.

3. **Recording Feature**
   - Add functionality to save the streamed video to a file on the server or client.

4. **Use H.264 Encoding**
   - Replace JPEG compression with H.264 for better video quality and reduced bandwidth usage.

5. **Threading/Async**
   - Use multithreading or asynchronous programming to handle video capture, compression, and streaming more efficiently.

6. **Encrypt Data**
   - Use TLS or other encryption methods to secure the video stream.

7. **GUI Interface**
   - Create a graphical user interface for starting/stopping the client and server.

8. **Face Detection**
   - Use OpenCV's face detection to highlight faces in the video stream.

9. **Motion Detection**
   - Add motion detection to trigger events or alerts.

10. **Streaming to Web**
    - Use WebRTC or Flask to stream video to a web browser.

11. **Optimize Frame Rate** 
    - Allow users to configure the frame rate and resolution for better performance on low-end systems.

12. **Authentication**
    - Add a simple authentication mechanism to restrict access to the server.

13. **Configuration File**
    - Use a configuration file for settings like IP, port, and compression quality.

14. **Unit Tests**
    - Write tests for individual components like video capture, compression, and streaming.

15. **Integration Tests**
    - Test the end-to-end functionality of the client-server setup.

## Deployment Enhancements

1. **Dockerize the Project**
   - Create Dockerfiles for easy deployment.

2. **Cloud Deployment**
   - Adapt the project for deployment on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.
